# Vulnerability Scanning
# Offensive-Security-OSCP-by-Offensive-Security (PAGE 206-209)

# Vulnerability finding is an intergral part of the security assessments. While doing manual, specialized taks that give the knowledge and experience during a seucrity audit, automated vulnerability scanners are nonetheless invaluable when is used in proper context. 

# vulnerability scanning most important check the outline basic considerations regarding both automated and manual scanning, and discuss both critical nuances.

# How Vulnerability Scanners Work
# The vulnerability scanner implementation vary, but there is priority follow a standard workflow, and most automated scanners will...
# 1. Detect if a target is up and running , 2. conduct a full or partial port scan, depending on the configurations
# 3. identify the operating system using by fingerprinting techniques or other mfa techonologies
# 4. attempt to identify running services/server with common tehcniques such as banner grabbing
# 5. execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilitys

# A penetration tester may execute some tpe of signature-matching process. Like may remembert that a particular version of an application in the field is vulnerable to a remote exploit. As an automated scanner performs this step with the assistance of unique vulnerability signatures.

# Part of the signature-matching process, there is many scanners can use banner grabbing, a siple technique where text string generated during an initial interaction with an application are obtained and analyzed.

# for example applications generate very specific banners such as OpenSSH which may return SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10, it will allowing to precisely pinpoint the application version. Another application example Apache Tomcat versions 4.1.x to 8.0x return a generic HTTP header of Apache-Coyote/1.1. 
# More specific of the headers and banners make it easier for the scanner to determine the application version and by extension to the accurately detect potential vulnerabilities.

# some vulnerability scanners can be configured to exploit a vulnerability upon detection. So this can reduce the likelihood of a false positive but it also increase the risk of crashing the service. Before that check scanner options carefully.

# Automated scanners insect a wide variety of other target information during the signature matching process. a strong signature match does not guarantee the presence of a vulnerability. Automated scanners can be generated quite a few false positives and by contrast, false negatives, which means a vulnerability is overlooked because of a signature mismatch.

# false positives and negatives can occur because of backporting, in which package maintainers will "roll back" software security patches to olders versions. Backporting may will give the result in the scanner floagging software as a vulnerable version when the vulnerability has actually been repaired.

# this is why should be more carefully inspect and mnually review vulnerability scan results whenever possible. It will given the ever-changing and complex technology landscape, vulnerabilities can show up in unexpected places. 

# it's good for pratices and it taking times to undestand the inner-workings of any automated tools for use in the field is an extremely valuable exercise. It will help to understand the limitations that must be overcome with manually-applied expertise.

# manual vs automated scanning

# Using the combine manual and automated scan tehcniques during an assessments, but it will proper balance more evident with expirences together.

# Primary advantages and siadvantages of manual and automated scannning in order will help to strike the proper balance during the an assessments. A manual review of a target of the remote entwork will inevitably be veyr resource-intensive and taking of the time. It is relies heavily on human interaction and repetitive taks, but it also prone to errors in which vulnerabilites may will be overlooked.

# Vulnerabilitys (read team) is required surgical precisions and a minimal network footprints in order to the remain undetected as long as possible. Using an automated scanner will be these types of the situations would not be the best way. In other words manual analysis allows for discovery of complex and logical vulnerabilities will rather dificcult to disocver using the any type of the automated scanner.

# Automated vulnerability scanners are invaluable when working on large engagements under the typical time constraints associated with traditional security assessments. When is using a general scanner across the entire target network or againsta single one of the dedicated host, so can establish a baseline in mmuch shorter of the time.

# The baselines allow to validate easily detected vulnerability or at the least help to understand the genral security posture of the target.

# Worthy vulnerability scanning can be have disvantages. Scan configurations can be extensive and complicated with defaults that could be harm the target. Like a many scanners can and will attempt to brute-force weak passwords. Brute-force techniques of the situations should be tightly regulated as it can lead to account lock-outs, it also can icur significant downtime for the client. It is important to understand how the vulnerability scanner works and what its properties are before doing executing a scan.

# Before using an automated vulnerability scanner, as a penetration tester is to provide value above and beyond the output of any tools.

# Internet Scanning vs Internal Scanning

# vulnerability scanners can easily scan Internet-connections from the targets as those connected to a local network. The scan results may be incoplete or inaccurate if treat the targets as equals.

# the network placement in relation to the target can be affect our speed threshold, access rights, likelihood of traffic interference and target visibility. The speed of the connection to the target netowkr dictates not only the raw bandwidth is available to our scanners, but for the other factors such as the number of hops to the individual hosts.

# The means penetration tester can conduct more intrusive and comphrehensive scans more quickly against locally-connected hosts. Before that must be mindful of our traffic at all times, realizing that older equipments may be adversely affected by heavy scans. For optimal results, consider guidelines established in the port scanning discussions.
