tämä on sama harjoitusta kuin ennenkin (koulutuksen ajalla 5.12.23 - 1.6.2024), mutta jotakin toistetaan ja otettu muualta screenshot ja harjoituksena kannalta hyvä kertaus

|       The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is

|       to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade
|       cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker
|       to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with

|   VULNERABLE:
|   Authentication bypass in MySQL servers.
|     State: VULNERABLE (Exploitable)
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2012-2122
|       When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA
|       over a password and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared
|       with the expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've
|       happened that the token and the expected value were considered equal,
|       even if the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case
|       MySQL/MariaDB would think that the password is correct, even while it is
|       not.  Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of
|       hitting this bug is about 1/256.
|       Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and "root" almost
|       always exists), she can connect using *any* password by repeating
|       connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a fraction of second, so
|       basically account password protection is as good as nonexistent.

|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
|           products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  BID:74733  CVE:CVE-2015-4000
|       The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is
|       triggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with
|       the DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
|       to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade
|       cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker
|       to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with
|       the encrypted stream.
