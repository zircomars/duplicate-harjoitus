# # this vulnerability scanning is same method as like an idea using Nessus open source applications. Using the Nmap scripting ENGINE (NSE) for perform automated vulnerability scanning. When NSE is not a full-fledged vulnerability scanner, it does have respectbale library of scripts that will be used to detect and validate vulnerabilities.

# NSE scripts are written by Lue and range in functionality from the brute force and authentication to detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities. This pratices will focus on the scripts in the "vuln" and the "exploit" categories, as detects a vulnerability and the latter attempts to exploit it.

# Never run NSE scripts blindly. Take time to inspect them to understand what they do before running them, and test on your own targets whenever possible
